Presentation for October 23, 2017 - Baltimore Python Meetup

This notebook was composed for the October 23, 2017 Baltimore Python Meetup. 
It is broken down into 2 sections.
Section 1: Composition of Decorators
Section 2: Functions - Why are they first class objects

Composition of Decorators
-------------------------
A @decorator is a function that alters the functionality of another 
function without having to directly change the source code of the 
function being decorated

A Python decorator is a specific change to the Python 
syntax that allows us to more conveniently alter functions and methods

Functions
---------
Functions are first class objects
  1. You can assign functions to variables
  2. You can pass functions as arguments
  3. You can have functions inside of functions (nested functions)
  4. You can return functions
